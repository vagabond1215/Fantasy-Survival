# Fantasy-Survival

Initial scaffold for a fantasy survival text-based builder. The project is
structured into modular core functions that share a central data store to avoid
duplicate or inconsistent data. Modules currently include:

- **buildings** ‚Äì available building types, constructed buildings and buildable
  options tied to unlocked technology.
- **population** ‚Äì procedurally generates the starting settlers, maintains
  biographies, and coordinates job assignments based on proficiencies.
- **people** ‚Äì population details and aggregate statistics.
- **inventory** ‚Äì resources with quantity, forecast supply, and demand tracking.
- **location** ‚Äì geographical generation based on biome.
- **map** ‚Äì generates 100√ó100 pixel color maps scaled to 100 m per tile (`GRID_DISTANCE_METERS`).
- **movement** ‚Äì converts tile distance and terrain into travel time.
- **proficiencies** ‚Äì character skills with diminishing returns and task metadata support.
- **technology** ‚Äì unlocked technologies which gate other features.
- **time** ‚Äì day and season progression.

The application is a static site and can be served locally via any HTTP server
that supports ES modules. The default entry point is `index.html` which loads
`src/main.js`.

## Gameplay systems

### Travel distance and time

Each map tile represents `GRID_DISTANCE_METERS` metres (currently 100 m). Movement between
tiles factors in terrain and obstacles via `calculateTravelTime` in `src/movement.js`:

- Open ground assumes a base pace of ~4.2 km/h.
- Forest and rocky (`ore`) tiles slow movement with higher multipliers.
- Water tiles require swimming skill; insufficient proficiency blocks movement and higher
  skill reduces the water penalty.

Diagonal moves automatically scale travel distance using the tile hypotenuse. Whenever a
move succeeds, the game advances time by the computed duration and logs the distance,
duration, and any additional difficulty messages.

### Inventory forecasting

The inventory view is now accessed from the floating menu (`üéí`). The popup lists:

- **Item** ‚Äì resource name with icon when available.
- **#** ‚Äì on-hand quantity.
- **Supply (+)** ‚Äì projected production from active/pending orders.
- **Demand (-)** ‚Äì projected consumption.

`updateInventoryFlows` in `src/gameUI.js` keeps inventory records synchronised by calling
`setItemFlow` for every known resource. When adding new orders, ensure the associated
`metadata` describes the resource effects so that forecasting stays accurate.

### Crafting workstations and hand production

Crafting recipes are organised in `src/data/recipes.js`. Each entry now declares a
`production` array that lists the supported workstations for that recipe. Hand crafting modes
(`id: manual`) remain available for simple goods and improvised meals, but they impose
efficiency penalties (lower output and slower labour). Building-backed stations‚Äîsuch as the
fire pit, drying rack, workshop benches, or forge bays‚Äîprovide improved multipliers once the
relevant structure is completed. `src/crafting.js` evaluates the player‚Äôs unlocked buildings
and automatically applies the best available production mode, while surfacing any missing
requirements when a recipe is gated. This keeps equipment, meals, and remedies tied directly
to the infrastructure that enables them.

### Proficiency system

`src/proficiencies.js` maintains settlement skills (hunting, tracking, fishing,
smithing, weaving, agriculture, construction, combat, and more). Each proficiency
stores a level between 1 and 100 and gains are awarded via `rewardOrderProficiency`
when orders complete. The expanded list covers every major craft and gathering role,
including smithing, smelting, pottery, leatherworking, carpentry, masonry, cooking,
and other settlement essentials.

Task metadata should include:

- `proficiencyId` ‚Äì which skill receives experience.
- `taskComplexity` ‚Äì 1‚Äì100 rating describing the difficulty of the task.
- `effortHours` ‚Äì total worker-hours invested.
- Optional `activity` and `taskId` strings for future analytics.

Simple tasks grant diminishing returns: repeatedly finishing low-complexity work (for
example cutting saplings) yields very small gains once a character outgrows the challenge.
To progress, queue harder work (such as felling massive trees or complex constructions).

Existing orders populate these fields automatically:

- Manual orders from the Jobs board use `createOrderMetadata` to infer proficiency and
  complexity from the type, worker count, hours, and optional notes (keywords like
  ‚Äúforage‚Äù or ‚Äúsapling‚Äù tailor the skill).
- Construction orders derive complexity from total labour and required resources inside
  `beginConstruction`.

Future features should follow the same pattern: define a `metadata` object when calling
`queueOrder` so that proficiencies and inventory projections remain accurate.

### Equipment catalog and supply chains

Equipment definitions now live in `src/data/equipment.js`. Each entry captures the
category, tier, durability, icon, and crafting materials for the weapon, armor, or tool so
that UI components and crafting logic can reference a single source of truth. Icon helpers
(`src/icons.js`) automatically surface these entries alongside dedicated resource icons for
supporting materials such as straight branches, seasoned wood, and prepared hides.

To keep every recipe ingredient attainable, new gathering and crafting loops fill the gaps:

- A sapling gathering prospect yields **straight branches** for tool shafts.
- Leatherworkers can cure **prepared hides** from raw hides, herbs, and plant fibers.
- Woodcutters can season timber into **seasoned wood** for bows and handles.
- Smelting recipes transform **raw ore** and fuel into bronze, iron, and steel ingots.

All new recipes live in `src/crafting.js` (and mirrored in `docs/src/crafting.js`) and obey the
same unlock rules as the equipment tiers they support. This ensures higher-tier equipment and
armor can be produced without requiring placeholder resources or manual inventory edits.

### Population generation and assignments

`src/population.js` produces the starting settlement roster. On a new game the module:

- Seeds a pseudo-random generator (optionally with the setup seed) and assembles
  family households.
- Ensures every settler is between 14 and 45 years of age with a mix of men and women.
- Assigns names, backstories, interests, talents (skill strengths), deficiencies
  (skill weaknesses), and family relationships (parents, children, spouses).
- Stores a skill profile that prefers relevant settlers for each job type.

`initializePopulation(size, { seed })` resets `store.people` with the generated roster.
`syncJobAssignments(store.jobs, listJobDefinitions())` (invoked automatically via
`getJobOverview` and `setJob`) ranks settlers for each job based on the preferred skill
list on every job definition, their talents/interests, and experience. The chosen
workers are surfaced on the job assignment screen so future updates can consult a
single source of truth instead of duplicating tracking logic.

## Development
